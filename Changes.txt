Factors of 0.5 errors are NOT fixed in the postprocessor, rather these issues were changed in the physics code to their (x 0.5) wrong values. 
So ignore factors of 0.5 message below


21	vLoad		
	Old:	load from one side
	New:	velocity obtained from characteristic value = w0 / Z0 
		Change: New is correct, Old is actually HALF the load 
			We NEED to correct where this is used in Matlab and use HALF of the value being currently used to make it work correctly
		I will multiply MatlabOldValue by 2

22	sLoad
		Same story
		Change old approach is wrong (Multiply old output by 2 and divide its use in Matlab by 2)


25	LoadApplication type
	Old	0 vel, 1 stress, stress w type 2
	New	0 vel, 1 stress, STRESS W TYPE 1 (so in new code there is NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRESS LOAD AND W LOAD). 
	I NEED TO CHANGE THIS BY TREATING TYPE 1 as TYPE 2 in NEW MATLAB because all my BCs are W

Can add Load increment type (constant (w), linear, step 1-0(stress), step 0-1-2-3-... (velocity)) as load profile in
data 
41 (mode I)
51 (mode II)

80	sigmaDamage / sigmaC 	Old	-1 (seems incorrect)
				New	1  (correct)
			Change: don't think I need to change it
82	a	damage model	Old -1 (cohesive model)
				New 1
			Change: No need to change


85	lC
				Old	0.0064197530864197518	formula cd tauC, tauC = deltaC * Z / sigmaC
				New	0.010873127313836181	formula E phiC / sigmaC^2
			Change: No change: both are scales I don't think we need to change as this variable should be used in matlab PP anyway


115	coh_post_process_loc_DissDot
				Old wrong	0.042200234852310663 is in fact energyTotal NOT Dot
				New correct	0.00033077626130622191	calculates correct value

			Change: Either fix the old code or do nothing
117	coh_post_process_loc_DissDamageDot
				Old	0.042200234852310663
				New	0.00033077626130622191
			Change: same as before

118 -1 (old) 1 (new) with choesive model. No need to change it


150 DisplaceLoad scale in general	
				Old wrong it's actually strain scale! 	0.012499999999999999
								uScale(i, 1) = l[i] / E;
				New correct
					150	name	disp_uC_uBarBulkI	1	abs	0.002730356528132282
			Change: Do nothing

151, ... stress scales, ... are factor of 2 difference. new one is the correct value




Some normalizations are 0 (bulk loads in mode II in a pure mode I case). Need to be careful with such regularizations in Matlab
