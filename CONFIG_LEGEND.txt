crackOpeningZero2MaxStress			CrackOpening from completely damaged point (Stress = 0) to the point that has maximum stress
							This is the difference of crack opening between end points of process zone size
rackOpeningZero2ZeroStress			This is only the absolute crack opening of the end point of process zone


For each plot data we have
plotAdditionalCurvesONPlots option 
	if > 0 it adds all the theoretical curves to the plots
	
	value 1 corresponds to TSL models and only print those relevant to this model
	value 2 corresponds to DAMAGE models and only print those relevant to this model

AdditionalPlotInfo:

optionNumber	lineColorOrBKNum	xlogFlag 	ylogFlag	    xAxisRegularSpace plotRegAheadCrackTip label

style and width of line are the same as Yu-Suo data

lineColorOrBKNum
-1 means it's number of input curves + 1

xAxisRegularSpace:
for plots of given time value (not crack tip ones) this set to 1 means x axis is space in regular scale (not velocity for example)

plotRegAheadCrackTip:
only applies to quasi-singular field plots where this set to 1, plot ahead of the crack tip as well (set to 0 only plots behind crack tip)
options are:	plotActual-Velocity-vs-x-x0-data			plot-Regression-line
-1 			0								0
0			1								0
1			1								1		

whether x or y data is log type
xlogBase 	ylogBase	
value 0 means this option is inactive

example is
	-1	-1	0	0	0	0	theory
	-1	-1	10	10	0	0	theory


optionNumber:
-1	Inactive
